Ken-ya Write a Story

The "Ken-ya Write a Story" prototype was created for a competition at Concordia's University @D3Centre as part of the **Ken-ya Innovate Challenge** (June 11, 2015)

This is a simple game to allow kids to practice writing stories in any language their teacher tells them to, with the goal to improve literacy.

This project is a starting point for a more ambitious program that involve variations of this game, and production of metrics for teachers to adjust their teaching, as well as curriculum designers. It is meant to be deployed on low-cost devices; and the game is simple enough to be ported to an SMS application.

It is live and deployed at http://kenyawriteastory.org/
